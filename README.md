### Hack for Freedom

Hack for Freedom is a virtual hackathon celebrating developers creating tools for grassroots collaboration. Global social unrest is a cry for help, and Web3 tools, specifically DAOs, could be extremely helpful.

Unfortunately, Web3's UX isn't ready for prime time yet. But we cannot get there fast enough. That's why we need hackers to help build this future to bring freedom to all.

Thanks to Aragon Connect, developers can now embed DAO functionality into their apps in just a few lines of code. This gives developers unprecedented power to create tools for social change.

Hack for Freedom will focus around creating communities and tools for grassroots collaboration using Aragon Connect.
